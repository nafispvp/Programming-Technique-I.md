# Programming Technique I
# Introduction
👨‍💼Lecturer : Dr Cik Suhaimi bin Yusof <br>
👨🏻‍🎓Section : 09

# 📝Summary
Programming Technique I introduces the fundamental concepts of programming and problem-solving using a structured approach. In this subject, I learned the basics of programming such as variables, data types, operators, input and output, control structures (selection and loops), functions, and arrays. The course focuses on writing clear, logical, and well-structured programs to solve simple computational problems.

# 🪞Reflection
This subject helped me develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and patience. I learned how to break down problems into smaller steps and solve them systematically. Programming Technique I also increased my confidence in programming and motivated me to explore more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming and data structures.
